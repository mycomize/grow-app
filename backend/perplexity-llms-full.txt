<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="New: Academic Filter for Scholarly Research" description="June 2025">
    We're excited to announce the release of our new academic filter feature, allowing you to tailor your searches specifically to academic and scholarly sources. By setting `search_mode: "academic"` in your API requests, you can now prioritize results from peer-reviewed papers, journal articles, and research publications.

    This feature is particularly valuable for:

    * Students and researchers working on academic papers
    * Professionals requiring scientifically accurate information
    * Anyone seeking research-based answers instead of general web content

    The academic filter works seamlessly with other search parameters like `search_context_size` and date filters, giving you precise control over your research queries.

    **Example:**

    ```bash
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions \
      --header 'accept: application/json' \
      --header 'authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
      --header 'content-type: application/json' \
      --data '{
        "model": "sonar-pro",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the scientific name of the lions mane mushroom?"}],
        "stream": false,
        "search_mode": "academic",
        "web_search_options": {"search_context_size": "low"}
    }'
    ```

    For detailed documentation and implementation examples, please see our [Academic Filter Guide](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/academic-filter-guide).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="New: Reasoning Effort Parameter for Sonar Deep Research" description="May 2025">
    We're excited to announce our new reasoning effort feature for sonar-deep-research. This lets you control how much computational effort the AI dedicates to each query. You can choose from "low", "medium", or "high" to get faster, simpler answers or deeper, more thorough responses.

    This feature has a direct impact on the amount of reasoning tokens consumed for each query, giving you the ability to control costs while balancing between speed and thoroughness.

    **Options:**

    * `"low"`: Faster, simpler answers with reduced token usage
    * `"medium"`: Balanced approach (default)
    * `"high"`: Deeper, more thorough responses with increased token usage

    **Example:**

    ```bash
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions \
      --header 'accept: application/json' \
      --header 'authorization: Bearer ${PPLX_KEY}' \
      --header 'content-type: application/json' \
      --data '{
        "model": "sonar-deep-research",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should I know before markets open today?"}],
        "stream": true,
        "reasoning_effort": "low"
      }'
    ```

    For detailed documentation and implementation examples, please see:
    [Sonar Deep Research Documentation](https://docs.perplexity.ai/models/models/sonar-deep-research)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="New: Asynchronous API for Sonar Deep Research" description="May 2025">
    We're excited to announce the addition of an asynchronous API for Sonar Deep Research, designed specifically for research-intensive tasks that may take longer to process.

    This new API allows you to submit requests and retrieve results later, making it ideal for complex research queries that require extensive processing time.

    The asynchronous API endpoints include:

    1. `GET https://api.perplexity.ai/async/chat/completions` - Lists all asynchronous chat completion requests for the authenticated user
    2. `POST https://api.perplexity.ai/async/chat/completions` - Creates an asynchronous chat completion job
    3. `GET https://api.perplexity.ai/async/chat/completions/{request_id}` - Retrieves the status and result of a specific asynchronous chat completion job

    **Note:** Async requests have a time-to-live (TTL) of 7 days. After this period, the request and its results will no longer be accessible.

    For detailed documentation and implementation examples, please see:
    [Sonar Deep Research Documentation](https://docs.perplexity.ai/models/models/sonar-deep-research)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enhanced API Responses with Search Results" description="May 2025">
    We've improved our API responses to give you more visibility into search data by adding a new `search_results` field to the JSON response object.

    This enhancement provides direct access to the search results used by our models, giving you more transparency and control over the information being used to generate responses.

    The `search_results` field includes:

    * `title`: The title of the search result page
    * `url`: The URL of the search result
    * `date`: The publication date of the content

    **Example:**

    ```json
    "search_results": [
      {
        "title": "Understanding Large Language Models",
        "url": "https://example.com/llm-article",
        "date": "2023-12-25"
      },
      {
        "title": "Advances in AI Research",
        "url": "https://example.com/ai-research",
        "date": "2024-03-15"
      }
    ]
    ```

    This update makes it easier to:

    * Verify the sources used in generating responses
    * Create custom citation formats for your applications
    * Filter or prioritize certain sources based on your needs

    **Important: The `citations` field is being deprecated in favor of the new `search_results` field.** Please update your applications to use the `search_results` field, as the `citations` field will be removed in a future update.

    The `search_results` field is now available across all our search-enabled models.

# Frequently Asked Questions
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/faq/faq



<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why isn't the `response_format` parameter working for reasoning models?">
    The `sonar-reasoning-pro` model is designed to output a `<think>` section containing reasoning tokens, immediately followed by a valid JSON object. As a result, the `response_format` parameter does not remove these reasoning tokens from the output.

    We recommend using a custom parser to extract the valid JSON portion. An example implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/ppl-ai/api-discussion/blob/main/utils/extract_json_reasoning_models.py).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does the API use content filtering or SafeSearch?">
    Yes, for the API, content filtering in the form of SafeSearch is turned on by default. This helps filter out potentially offensive and inappropriate content, including pornography, from search results. SafeSearch is an automated filter that works across search results to provide a safer experience. You can learn more about SafeSearch on the [official Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SafeSearch).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I file a bug report and what happens afterward?">
    To file a bug report, please use our GitHub repository and file the bug in [issues](https://github.com/ppl-ai/api-discussion/issues). Once you've submitted your report, we kindly ask that you share the link to the issue with us via email at [api@perplexity.ai](mailto:api@perplexity.ai) so we can track it on our end.

    We truly appreciate your patience, and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Due to the current volume of reports, it may take a little time for us to respond—but rest assured, we're on it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where are Perplexity's language models hosted?">
    Our compute is hosted via Amazon Web Services in North America. By default, the API has zero day retention of user prompt data, which is never used for AI training.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I upgrade to the next usage tier?">
    The only way for an account to be upgraded to the next usage tier is through all-time credit purchase.

    Here are the spending criteria associated with each tier:

    | Tier   | Credit Purchase (all time) |
    | ------ | -------------------------- |
    | Tier 0 | -                          |
    | Tier 1 | \$50                       |
    | Tier 2 | \$250                      |
    | Tier 3 | \$500                      |
    | Tier 4 | \$1000                     |
    | Tier 5 | \$5000                     |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I track my spend/usage per API key?">
    We offer a way to track your billing per API key. You can do this by navigating to the following location:

    **Settings > View Dashboard > Invoice history > Invoices**

    Then click on any invoice and each item from the total bill will have a code at the end of it (e.g., pro (743S)). Those 4 characters are the last 4 of your API key.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I request a new feature?">
    A Feature Request is a suggestion to improve or add new functionality to the Perplexity Sonar API, such as:

    * Requesting support for a new model or capability (e.g., image processing, fine-tuning options)
    * Asking for new API parameters (e.g., additional filters, search options)
    * Suggesting performance improvements (e.g., faster response times, better citation handling)
    * Enhancing existing API features (e.g., improving streaming reliability, adding new output formats)

    If your request aligns with these, please submit a feature request here: [Github Feature requests](https://github.com/ppl-ai/api-discussion/issues)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why are the results from the API different from the UI? ">
    1. The API uses the same search system as the UI with differences in configuration—so their outputs may differ.
    2. The underlying AI model might differ between the API and the UI for a given query.
    3. We give users the power to tune the API to their respective use cases using sampling parameters like `presence_penalty`, `top_p`, etc. Custom tuning to specific use cases might lead to less generalization compared to the UI. We set optimized defaults and recommend not to explicitly provide sampling parameters in your API requests.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will user data submitted through the API be used for model training or other purposes?">
    We collect the following types of information:

    **API Usage Data:** We collect billable usage metadata such as the number of requests and tokens. You can view your own usage in the [Perplexity API dashboard](https://perplexity.ai/settings/api).

    **User Account Information:** When you create an account with us, we collect your name, email address, and other relevant contact information.

    We do not retain any query data sent through the API and do not train on any of your data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does the API currently support web browsing?">
    Yes, the [Sonar Models](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/model-cards) leverage information from Perplexity's search index and the public internet.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the limitations to the number of API calls?">
    You can find our [rate limits here](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/usage-tiers).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the best way to stay up to date with API updates?">
    We email users about new developments and also post in the [changelog](/changelog.mdx).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How should I respond to 401: Authorization errors?">
    401 error codes indicate that the provided API key is invalid, deleted, or belongs to an account which ran out of credits. You likely need to purchase more credits in the [Perplexity API dashboard](https://perplexity.ai/settings/api). You can avoid this issue by configuring auto-top-up.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you support fine-tuning?">
    Currently, we do not support fine-tuning.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I have another question or an issue">
    Please reach out to [api@perplexity.ai](mailto:api@perplexity.ai) or [support@perplexity.ai](mailto:support@perplexity.ai) for other API inquiries. You can also post on our [discussion forum](https://github.com/ppl-ai/api-discussion/discussions) and we will get back to you.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Perplexity provide service quality assurances such as service uptime, frequency of failures, and target recovery time in the event of a failure?">
    We do not guarantee this at the moment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where are your DeepSeek reasoning models behind Sonar Reasoning and Sonar Reasoning Pro hosted? Is my data going to China?">
    The models are hosted in the US and we do not train on any of your data. And no, your data is not going to China.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are your reasoning APIs that use DeepSeek uncensored?">
    Yes, our reasoning APIs that use DeepSeek's models are uncensored and on par with the other APIs in terms of content moderation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you expose CoTs if I use your reasoning APIs or Deep Research API?">
    We expose the CoTs for Sonar Reasoning Pro and Sonar Reasoning. We don't currently expose the CoTs for Deep Research.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does R1-1776 search the web?">
    R1-1776 is an offline chat model that does not search the web. So this model might not have the most up-to-date information beyond its training cutoff date—which should be the same as R1.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are the reasoning tokens in Deep Research same as CoTs in the answer?">
    Reasoning tokens in Deep Research are a bit different than the CoTs in the answer—these tokens are used to reason through the research material before generating the final output via the CoTs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is the internet data access provided by the API identical to that of Perplexity's web interface?">
    Yes, the API offers exactly the same internet data access as Perplexity's web platform.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="To what extent is the API OpenAI compatible?">
    The Perplexity API is designed to be broadly compatible with OpenAI's chat completions endpoint. It adopts a similar structure—including fields such as `id`, `model`, and `usage`—and supports analogous parameters like `model`, `messages`, and `stream`.

    **Key Differences from the standard OpenAI response include:**

    * **Response Object Structure:**
      * OpenAI responses typically have an `object` value of `"chat.completion"` and a `created` timestamp, whereas our response uses `object: "response"` and a `created_at` field.
      * Instead of a `choices` array, our response content is provided under an `output` array that contains detailed message objects.

    * **Message Details:**
      * Each message in our output includes a `type` (usually `"message"`), a unique `id`, and a `status`.
      * The actual text is nested within a `content` array that contains objects with `type`, `text`, and an `annotations` array for additional context.

    * **Additional Fields:**
      * Our API response provides extra meta-information (such as `status`, `error`, `incomplete_details`, `instructions`, and `max_output_tokens`) that are not present in standard OpenAI responses.
      * The `usage` field also differs, offering detailed breakdowns of input and output tokens (including fields like `input_tokens_details` and `output_tokens_details`).

    These differences are intended to provide enhanced functionality and additional context while maintaining broad compatibility with OpenAI's API design.

# Academic Filter Guide
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/academic-filter-guide



<Note>
  The `search_mode: "academic"` parameter allows you to tailor your searches specifically to academic and scholarly sources, prioritizing peer-reviewed papers, journal articles, and research publications.
</Note>

## Overview

The academic filter—sometimes referred to as "academic mode" or "Focus: Academic"—is a feature in Perplexity that allows users to target their searches specifically to academic and scholarly sources. This is especially useful for students, researchers, and professionals who require peer-reviewed papers, journal articles, and research-focused answers rather than general web content.

When you activate the academic filter by setting `search_mode: "academic"`, Perplexity prioritizes results from scholarly databases, journals, and reputable academic publications, filtering out non-academic or general web sources. This ensures that the answers you receive are grounded in research and scholarly consensus.

## Key Features and Functionality

* **Source Filtering**: Prioritizes scholarly databases, academic journals, and research publications
* **Research Focus**: Returns results based on peer-reviewed research rather than general web content
* **Enhanced Precision**: Provides more technical and discipline-specific information for academic queries
* **Compatibility**: Works with other search parameters like `search_context_size` to further refine results

## Usage Examples

### Basic Academic Search

This example shows how to perform a basic search using the academic filter.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions \
    --header 'accept: application/json' \
    --header 'authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      "model": "sonar-pro",
      "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the scientific name of the lions mane mushroom?"}],
      "stream": false,
      "search_mode": "academic",
      "web_search_options": {"search_context_size": "low"}
  }'
  ```

  ```python Python
  import requests

  url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
  headers = {
      "accept": "application/json",
      "authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
      "content-type": "application/json"
  }
  payload = {
      "model": "sonar-pro",
      "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the scientific name of the lions mane mushroom?"}],
      "stream": False,
      "search_mode": "academic",
      "web_search_options": {"search_context_size": "low"}
  }

  response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
  print(response.json())
  ```

  ```javascript Node.js
  const axios = require('axios');

  const url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions";
  const headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "content-type": "application/json"
  };
  const payload = {
    "model": "sonar-pro",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the scientific name of the lions mane mushroom?"}],
    "stream": false,
    "search_mode": "academic",
    "web_search_options": {"search_context_size": "low"}
  };

  axios.post(url, payload, { headers })
    .then(response => console.log(response.data))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Combining Academic Mode with Other Parameters

You can combine the academic filter with other parameters for more refined searches:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions \
    --header 'accept: application/json' \
    --header 'authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      "model": "sonar-deep-research",
      "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the latest findings on neural networks for image recognition?"}],
      "stream": false,
      "search_mode": "academic",
      "search_after_date_filter": "1/1/2023",
      "web_search_options": {"search_context_size": "high"}
  }'
  ```

  ```python Python
  import requests

  url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
  headers = {
      "accept": "application/json",
      "authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
      "content-type": "application/json"
  }
  payload = {
      "model": "sonar-deep-research",
      "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the latest findings on neural networks for image recognition?"}],
      "stream": False,
      "search_mode": "academic",
      "search_after_date_filter": "1/1/2023",
      "web_search_options": {"search_context_size": "high"}
  }

  response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
  print(response.json())
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Recommended Use Cases

The academic filter is particularly valuable for:

1. **Research Literature Reviews**: When you need to gather scholarly information on a specific topic
2. **Technical and Scientific Queries**: For questions requiring scientifically accurate, peer-reviewed answers
3. **Academic Writing Assistance**: When working on papers, theses, or dissertations that require scholarly sources
4. **Educational Support**: For students and educators requiring academically rigorous information

## Best Practices

### Optimizing Academic Searches

* **Be Specific**: Formulate clear, focused questions to receive more precise academic responses
* **Use Technical Terminology**: Include field-specific terms to better target relevant academic literature
* **Combine with Date Filters**: For the most recent research, combine with `search_after_date_filter`
* **Adjust Context Size**: Use higher `search_context_size` values for more comprehensive academic responses

### Performance Considerations

* Academic searches may sometimes take slightly longer due to the specialized nature of scholarly databases
* Consider using models like `sonar-deep-research` for particularly complex academic inquiries
* For more comprehensive literature reviews, set `stream: false` to receive complete responses

### Limitations

* Availability of academic sources varies by field and topic
* Very recent research (published within the last few months) may not always be included
* Some paywalled or subscription-only academic content may not be fully accessible

# Perplexity Crawlers
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/bots

We strive to improve our service every day by delivering the best search experience possible. To achieve this, we collect data using web crawlers (“robots”) and user agents that gather and index information from the internet, operating either automatically or in response to user requests. Webmasters can use the following robots.txt tags to manage how their sites and content interact with Perplexity. Each setting works independently, and it may take up to 24 hours for our systems to reflect changes.

| User Agent      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

# Date Range Filter Guide
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/date-range-filter-guide



<Note>
  The `search_after_date_filter` and `search_before_date_filter` parameters allow you to restrict search results to a specific publication date range. Only results with publication dates falling between these dates will be returned.
</Note>

<Info>
  Dates must be provided in the "%m/%d/%Y" format (e.g., "3/1/2025"). These filters are optional—you may supply either one or both as needed.
</Info>

## Overview

The `search_after_date_filter` and `search_before_date_filter` parameters control which search results are returned by limiting them to a specific publication date range. This feature is useful when you need to:
•	Narrow down search results to a particular time period
•	Exclude outdated or overly recent content
•	Improve relevance by focusing on content published within a defined window

To constrain search results by publication date, include the following fields in your request payload:

```bash
"search_after_date_filter": "3/1/2025",
"search_before_date_filter": "3/5/2025"
```

These filters will be applied in addition to any other search parameters (for example, domain filters).

## Examples

**1. Limiting Results to a Specific Date Range**

This example limits search results to content published between March 1, 2025, and March 5, 2025.

**Request Example**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl --location 'https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      "model": "sonar-pro",
      "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert on current events."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Show me tech news published this week."}
      ],
      "search_after_date_filter": "3/1/2025",
      "search_before_date_filter": "3/5/2025"
  }'
  ```

  ```python python
  import requests

  url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
  headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
  payload = {
      "model": "sonar-pro",
      "messages": [
          {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert on current events."},
          {"role": "user", "content": "Show me tech news published this week."}
      ],
      "search_after_date_filter": "3/1/2025",
      "search_before_date_filter": "3/5/2025"
  }

  response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
  print(response.json())
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**2. Filtering with a Single Date Parameter**

If you only wish to restrict the results to those published on or after a specific date, include just the `search_after_date_filter`:

```bash
payload = {
    "model": "sonar-pro",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Show me news articles published after March 1, 2025."}
    ],
    "search_after_date_filter": "3/1/2025"
}
```

## Best Practices

**Date Format**
•	Strict Format: Dates must match the “%m/%d/%Y” format exactly. For example, the date “3/1/2025” or “03/01/2025” is acceptable.
•	Consistency: Use one or both filters consistently based on your search needs. Combining both provides a clear range.

**Client-Side Validation**
•	Regex Check: Validate date strings on the client side (or via the API) using a regex such as:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash
  date_regex='^(0?[1-9]|1[0-2])/(0?[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])/[0-9]{4}$'
  ```

  ```python
  date_regex = r'^(0?[1-9]|1[0-2])/(0?[1-9]|[12]\d|3[01])/\d{4}$'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This ensures that dates conform to the required format before sending the request.

**Performance Considerations**
•	Narrowing the Search: Applying date range filters typically reduces the number of results, which may improve response times and result relevance.
•	Avoid Over-Restriction: Ensure that the date range is neither too narrow (limiting useful results) nor too broad (defeating the purpose of the filter).

# Image Filters Guide
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/image-filter-guide

Control image results with domain and format filters using the Perplexity API.

<Note>
  The `image_domain_filter` and `image_format_filter` parameters allow you to control the sources and file types of image results returned by the Sonar models.
</Note>

<Warning>
  You can include a maximum of 10 entries in each of the filter lists. These filters currently apply only when `"return_images": true` is set in your request.
</Warning>

## Overview

The `image_domain_filter` and `image_format_filter` parameters give you fine-grained control over image results returned by the Sonar models. Use these filters to:

* Exclude specific image providers (e.g., Getty Images)
* Restrict to a specific file format (e.g., `.gif`)

To use these filters, your request must include `"return_images": true`.

```json
{
  "image_domain_filter": ["-gettyimages.com"],
  "image_format_filter": ["gif"]
}
```

•	Prefix domains with - to exclude them
•	Use lowercase file extensions like gif, jpg, or png
⸻

## Examples

### 1. Exclude Specific Image Domains

This request filters out images from Getty Images.

<CodeGroup>
  ```cURL cURL
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      "model": "sonar",
      "return_images": true,
      "image_domain_filter": ["-gettyimages.com"],
      "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Show me images of Mount Everest"}
      ]
    }'
  ```

  ```python python
  import requests

  url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
  headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
  payload = {
    "model": "sonar",
    "return_images": True,
    "image_domain_filter": ["-gettyimages.com"],
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Show me images of Mount Everest"}
    ]
  }

  response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
  print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
  ```
</CodeGroup>

⸻

### 2. Only Return GIFs

This request restricts results to GIF images.

<CodeGroup>
  ```cURL cURL
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      "model": "sonar",
      "return_images": true,
      "image_format_filter": ["gif"],
      "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Show me a funny cat gif"}
      ]
    }'
  ```

  ```python python
  import requests

  url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
  headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
  payload = {
    "model": "sonar",
    "return_images": True,
    "image_format_filter": ["gif"],
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Show me a funny cat gif"}
    ]
  }

  response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
  print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
  ```
</CodeGroup>

⸻

## 3. Combine Domain and Format Filters

You can combine both filters for precise control.

<CodeGroup>
  ```cURL cURL
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      "model": "sonar",
      "return_images": true,
      "image_domain_filter": ["-gettyimages.com"],
      "image_format_filter": ["gif"],
      "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Show me a gif of a dog"}
      ]
    }'
  ```

  ```python python
  import requests

  url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
  headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
  payload = {
    "model": "sonar",
    "return_images": True,
    "image_domain_filter": ["-gettyimages.com"],
    "image_format_filter": ["gif"],
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Show me a gif of a dog"}
    ]
  }

  response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
  print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
  ```
</CodeGroup>

⸻

## Best Practices

**Domain Filtering**
•	Use simple domain names like example.com or -gettyimages.com
•	Do not include http\://, https\://, or subdomains

**Format Filtering**
•	File extensions must be lowercase: \["jpg"], not \["JPG"]
•	Omit dot prefix: use gif, not .gif

**Filter Strategy**
•	You can mix inclusion and exclusion in domain filters
•	Keep lists short (≤10 entries) for performance and relevance

**Performance Notes**
•	Filters may slightly increase response time
•	Overly restrictive filters may reduce result quality or quantity


# Image Guide
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/image-guide

Learn how to use Sonar's image upload feature.

<Note>
  The image upload feature allows you to include images in your API requests to support multi-modal conversations alongside text. Images can be provided either as base64 encoded strings within a data URI or as standard HTTPS URLs.
</Note>

<Warning>
  * When using base64 encoding, the API currently only supports images up to 5 MB per image.
  * Supported formats for base64 encoded images: PNG (image/png), JPEG (image/jpeg), WEBP (image/webp), and GIF (image/gif).
  * When using an HTTPS URL, the model will attempt to fetch the image from the provided URL. Ensure the URL is publicly accessible.
</Warning>

Image uploads can be useful for:

* Asking questions about visual content (e.g., text in a screenshot, diagram interpretation)
* Providing context for follow-up queries
* Analyzing visual media as part of a multi-turn conversation

⸻

## Overview

To include an image in a request, you can either:

1. Encode the image as a base64 string and embed it in a data URI using the following format:
   ```bash
   data:image/png;base64,<BASE64_ENCODED_IMAGE>
   ```
   Replace `image/png` with the correct MIME type if you're using JPEG or GIF (`image/jpeg` or `image/gif`).
2. Provide a standard HTTPS URL pointing directly to the image file:
   ```
   https://example.com/path/to/your/image.png
   ```

This data URI or HTTPS URL should be included in your API request as part of a `messages` array, using the `image_url` content type.

⸻

## Request Format

Images must be embedded in the `messages` array, alongside any text input. Each image should be provided using the following structure:

**Using Base64 Data URI:**

```json
{
  "type": "image_url",
  "image_url": {
    "url": "data:image/png;base64,<BASE64_ENCODED_IMAGE>"
  }
}
```

**Using HTTPS URL:**

```json
{
  "type": "image_url",
  "image_url": {
    "url": "https://example.com/path/to/your/image.png"
  }
}
```

⸻

## Examples

2. If it is a list of suggestions, first, write a brief and natural introduction based on the original query.
3. Followed by a list of suggestions, each suggestion should be split by two newlines.
```

## User Prompt

You should use the user prompt to pass in the actual query for which you need an answer for. The user prompt will be used to kick off a real-time web search to make sure the answer has the latest and the most relevant information needed.

**Example of a user prompt**

```
What are the best sushi restaurants in the world currently?
```

# Web Search Models: General Prompting Guidelines

Our web search-powered models combine the capabilities of LLMs with real-time web searches. Understanding how they differ from traditional LLMs will help you craft more effective prompts.

## Best Practices for Prompting Web Search Models

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Be Specific and Contextual">
    Unlike traditional LLMs, our web search models require specificity to retrieve relevant search results. Adding just 2-3 extra words of context can dramatically improve performance.

    **Good Example**: "Explain recent advances in climate prediction models for urban planning"

    **Poor Example**: "Tell me about climate models"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Avoid Few-Shot Prompting">
    While few-shot prompting works well for traditional LLMs, it confuses web search models by triggering searches for your examples rather than your actual query.

    **Good Example**: "Summarize the current research on mRNA vaccine technology"

    **Poor Example**: "Here's an example of a good summary about vaccines: \[example text]. Now summarize the current research on mRNA vaccines."
  </Card>

  <Card title="Think Like a Web Search User">
    Craft prompts with search-friendly terms that would appear on relevant web pages. Consider how experts in the field would describe the topic online.

    **Good Example**: "Compare the energy efficiency ratings of heat pumps vs. traditional HVAC systems for residential use"

    **Poor Example**: "Tell me which home heating is better"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Provide Relevant Context">
    Include critical context to guide the web search toward the most relevant content, but keep prompts concise and focused.

    **Good Example**: "Explain the impact of the 2023 EU digital markets regulations on app store competition for small developers"

    **Poor Example**: "What are the rules for app stores?"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Web Search Model Pitfalls to Avoid

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Overly Generic Questions">
    Generic prompts lead to scattered web search results and unfocused responses. Always narrow your scope.

    **Avoid**: "What's happening in AI?"

    **Instead**: "What are the three most significant commercial applications of generative AI in healthcare in the past year?"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Traditional LLM Techniques">
    Prompting strategies designed for traditional LLMs often don't work well with web search models. Adapt your approach accordingly.

    **Avoid**: "Act as an expert chef and give me a recipe for sourdough bread. Start by explaining the history of sourdough, then list ingredients, then..."

    **Instead**: "What's a reliable sourdough bread recipe for beginners? Include ingredients and step-by-step instructions."
  </Card>

  <Card title="Complex Multi-Part Requests">
    Complex prompts with multiple unrelated questions can confuse the search component. Focus on one topic per query.

    **Avoid**: "Explain quantum computing, and also tell me about regenerative agriculture, and provide stock market predictions."

    **Instead**: "Explain quantum computing principles that might impact cryptography in the next decade."
  </Card>

  <Card title="Assuming Search Intent">
    Don't assume the model will search for what you intended without specific direction. Be explicit about exactly what information you need.

    **Avoid**: "Tell me about the latest developments."

    **Instead**: "What are the latest developments in offshore wind energy technology announced in the past 6 months?"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Advanced Techniques

<Tip>
  We recommend for users *not* to tune language parameters such as `temperature`, as the default settings for these have already been optimized.
</Tip>

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Parameter Optimization">
    Adjust model parameters based on your specific needs:

    * **Search Domain Filter**: Limit results to trusted sources for research-heavy queries.
    * **Search Context Size**: Use "high" for comprehensive research questions and "low" for simple factual queries.

    Example configuration for technical documentation:

    ```json
    {
      "search_domain_filter": ["wikipedia.org", "docs.python.org"],
      "web_search_options": {
        "search_context_size": "medium"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Tips for Different Query Types

# Search Context Size
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/search-context-size-guide



<Note>
  The `search_context_size` parameter allows you to control how much search context is retrieved from the web during query resolution, letting you balance cost and comprehensiveness.
</Note>

<Warning>
  * Default `search_context_size` is `low`
  * Selecting `"high"` increases search costs due to more extensive web retrieval. Use `"low"` when cost efficiency is critical.
</Warning>

## Overview

The `search_context_size` field—passed via the `web_search_options` object—determines how much search context is retrieved by the Sonar models. This setting can help you optimize for either:

* Cost savings with minimal search input (`low`)
* Comprehensive answers by maximizing retrieved information (`high`)
* A balance of both (`medium`)

This flexibility allows teams to tune their API usage to their budget and use case.

To enable this feature, include the web\_search\_options.search\_context\_size parameter in your request payload:

```bash
"web_search_options": {
  "search_context_size": "medium"
}
```

## Best Practices

**Choosing the Right Context Size**

* `low`: Best for short factual queries or when operating under strict token cost constraints.
* `medium`: The default and best suited for general use cases.
* `high`: Use for deep research, exploratory questions, or when citations and evidence coverage are critical.

**Cost Optimization**

* Selecting `low` or `medium` can significantly reduce overall token usage, especially at scale.
* Consider defaulting to `low` for high-volume endpoints and selectively upgrading to `high` for complex user prompts.

Combining with Other Filters

* You can use `search_context_size` alongside other features like `search_domain_filter` to further control the scope of search.
* Combining `medium` with a focused domain filter often gives a good tradeoff between quality and cost.

Performance Considerations

* Larger context sizes may slightly increase response latency due to more extensive search and reranking.
* If you’re batching queries or supporting real-time interfaces, test with different settings to balance user experience and runtime.

## Examples

**1. Minimal Search Context ("low")**

This option limits the search context retrieved for the model, reducing cost per request while still producing useful responses for simpler questions.

## Request

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      "model": "sonar",
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "system",
          "content": "Be precise and concise."
        },
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "How many stars are there in our galaxy?"
        }
      ],
      "web_search_options": {
        "search_context_size": "low"
      }
    }'
  ```

  ```python python
  import requests

  url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
  headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
  payload = {
      "model": "sonar",
      "messages": [
          {"role": "system", "content": "Be precise and concise."},
          {"role": "user", "content": "How many stars are there in our galaxy?"}
      ],
      "web_search_options": {
          "search_context_size": "low"
      }
  }

  response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
  print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Pro-tip**: Use `low` when cost optimization is more important than answer completeness.

**2. Comprehensive Search Context ("high")**

This option maximizes the amount of search context used to answer the question, resulting in more thorough and nuanced responses.

## Request

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      "model": "sonar-reasoning-pro",
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "system",
          "content": "Be precise and concise."
        },
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "Explain the economic causes of the 2008 financial crisis."
        }
      ],
      "web_search_options": {
        "search_context_size": "high"
      }
    }'
  ```

  ```python python
  import requests

  url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
  headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
  payload = {
      "model": "sonar-reasoning-pro",
      "messages": [
          {"role": "system", "content": "Be precise and concise."},
          {"role": "user", "content": "Explain the economic causes of the 2008 financial crisis."}
      ],
      "web_search_options": {
          "search_context_size": "high"
      }
  }
  response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
  print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Pro-tip**: Use `high` for research-heavy or nuanced queries where coverage matters more than cost.

# Search Domain Filter Guide
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/search-domain-filters



<Note>
  The `search_domain_filter` feature allows you to limit search results to specific domains or exclude certain domains from search results.
</Note>

<Warning>
  You can add a maximum of 10 domains to the `search_domain_filter` list.
</Warning>

## Overview

The `search_domain_filter` parameter allows you to control which websites are included in or excluded from the search results used by the Sonar models. This feature is particularly useful when you want to:

* Restrict search results to trusted sources
* Filter out specific domains from search results
* Focus research on particular websites

Enabling domain filtering can be done by adding a `search_domain_filter` field in the request:

```
"search_domain_filter": [
  "<domain1>",
  "<domain2>",
  ...
]
```

Each entry in the list should be a simple domain name. To exclude a domain, prefix it with a minus sign (`-`).

## Examples

### 1. Allowlist Specific Domains

This example shows how to limit search results to only include content from specific domains.

**Request**

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
payload = {
    "model": "sonar-reasoning-pro",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about the James Webb Space Telescope discoveries."}
    ],
    "search_domain_filter": [
        "nasa.gov",
        "wikipedia.org",
        "space.com"
    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

**Best Practice**: Use simple domain names (e.g., `wikipedia.org`) without additional elements like `https://` or `www.` prefixes.

### 2. Denylist Specific Domains

This example shows how to exclude specific domains from search results by prefixing the domain name with a minus sign (`-`).

**Request**

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
payload = {
    "model": "sonar-deep-research",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What are the latest advancements in renewable energy?"}
    ],
    "search_domain_filter": [
        "-pinterest.com",
        "-reddit.com",
        "-quora.com"
    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

**Best Practice**: Use simple domain names with a minus prefix (e.g., `-pinterest.com`) to exclude domains from search results.

## Best Practices

### Domain Specification

* **Use simple domain names**: Specify domains in their simplest form (e.g., `example.com`) without protocol prefixes (`http://`, `https://`) or subdomain specifiers (`www.`).
* **Main domains only**: Using the main domain (e.g., `nytimes.com`) will filter all subdomains as well.

### Filter Optimization

* **Be specific**: Use domains that are most relevant to your query to get the best results.
* **Combine approaches**: You can mix inclusion and exclusion in the same request (e.g., `["wikipedia.org", "-pinterest.com"]`).
* **Limit filter size**: Although you can add up to 10 domains, using fewer, more targeted domains often yields better results.

### Performance Considerations

* Adding domain filters may slightly increase response time as the search engine needs to apply additional filtering.
* Overly restrictive domain filters might result in fewer search results, potentially affecting the quality of the response.


# Structured Outputs Guide
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/structured-outputs



<Info>
  The first request with a new JSON Schema or Regex expects to incur delay on the first token. Typically, it takes 10 to 30 seconds to prepare the new schema, and may result in timeout errors. Once the schema has been prepared, the subsequent requests will not see such delay.
</Info>

## Overview

We currently support two types of structured outputs: **JSON Schema** and **Regex**. LLM responses will work to match the specified format, except for the following cases:

* The output exceeds `max_tokens`

Enabling the structured outputs can be done by adding a `response_format` field in the request:

**JSON Schema**

* `response_format: { type: "json_schema", json_schema: {"schema": object} }` .

* The schema should be a valid JSON schema object.

**Regex** (only available for `sonar` right now)

* `response_format: { type: "regex", regex: {"regex": str} }` .

* The regex is a regular expression string.

We recommend to give the LLM some hints about the output format in the prompts.

## Examples

### 1. Get a response in JSON format

**Request**

```python
import requests
from pydantic import BaseModel

class AnswerFormat(BaseModel):
    first_name: str
    last_name: str
    year_of_birth: int
    num_seasons_in_nba: int

url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
payload = {
    "model": "sonar",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "Be precise and concise."},
        {"role": "user", "content": (
            "Tell me about Michael Jordan. "
            "Please output a JSON object containing the following fields: "
            "first_name, last_name, year_of_birth, num_seasons_in_nba. "
        )},
    ],
    "response_format": {
		    "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {"schema": AnswerFormat.model_json_schema()},
    },
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

**Response**

```
{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Jordan","year_of_birth":1963,"num_seasons_in_nba":15}
```

### 2. Use a regex to output the format

**Request**

```python python
import requests

url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
payload = {
    "model": "sonar",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "Be precise and concise."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the IPv4 address of OpenDNS DNS server?"},
    ],
    "response_format": {
		    "type": "regex",
        "regex": {"regex": r"(?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.){3}(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)"},
    },
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

**Response**

```
208.67.222.222
```

## Best Practices

### Generating responses in a JSON Format

For Python users, we recommend using the Pydantic library to [generate JSON schema](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/base_model/#pydantic.BaseModel.model_json_schema).

**Unsupported JSON Schemas**

Recursive JSON schema is not supported. As a result of that, unconstrained objects are not supported either. Here's a few example of unsupported schemas:

```
# UNSUPPORTED!

from typing import Any

class UnconstrainedDict(BaseModel):
   unconstrained: dict[str, Any]

class RecursiveJson(BaseModel):
   value: str
   child: list["RecursiveJson"]
```

### Generating responses using a regex

**Supported Regex**

* Characters: `\d`, `\w`, `\s` , `.`
* Character classes: `[0-9A-Fa-f]` , `[^x]`
* Quantifiers: `*`, `?` , `+`, `{3}`, `{2,4}` , `{3,}`
* Alternation: `|`
* Group: `( ... )`
* Non-capturing group: `(?: ... )`
* Positive lookahead: `(?= ... )`
* Negative lookahead: `(?! ... )`

**Unsupported Regex**

* Contents of group: `\1`
* Anchors: `^`, `$`, `\b`
* Positive look-behind: `(?<= ... )`
* Negative look-behind: `(?<! ... )`
* Recursion: `(?R)`

## Structured Outputs for Reasoning Models

When using structured outputs with reasoning models like `sonar-reasoning-pro`, the response will include a `<think>` section containing reasoning tokens, immediately followed by the structured output. The `response_format` parameter does not remove these reasoning tokens from the output, so the final response will need to be parsed manually.

**Sample Response:**

```
<think>
I need to provide information about France in a structured JSON format with specific fields: country, capital, population, official_language.

For France:
- Country: France
- Capital: Paris
- Population: About 67 million (as of 2023)
- Official Language: French

Let me format this information as required.
</think>
{"country":"France","capital":"Paris","population":67750000,"official_language":"French"}
```

For a reusable implementation to extract JSON from reasoning model outputs, see our [example utility on GitHub](https://github.com/ppl-ai/api-discussion/blob/main/utils/extract_json_reasoning_models.py).

# User Location Filter Guide
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/user-location-filter-guide



<Note>
  The `user_location` parameter within `web_search_options` allows you to refine search results based on the user's approximate geographic location. This helps provide more contextually relevant information.
</Note>

<Info>
  You can specify the location using either using latitude/longitude coordinates *and* a two-letter ISO country code, or only a two-letter ISO country code. For supported country codes, please refer to the list [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes).
</Info>

<Warning>
  Latitude and longitude must be provided alongside the country parameter, they cannot be provided on their own.
</Warning>

## Overview

The `user_location` filter helps tailor search results by incorporating geographic context. This is particularly useful for queries where location significantly impacts relevance, such as:

* Finding local businesses or services.
* Getting information about regional events or news.
* Understanding location-specific regulations or customs.

To refine search results by location, include the `user_location` object within the `web_search_options` in your request payload. You can provide coordinates, a country code, or combine them:

**Using Latitude/Longitude:**

```json
"web_search_options": {
  "user_location": {
    "country":"US",
    "latitude": 37.7749,
    "longitude": -122.4194
  }
}
```

**Using Country Code:**

```json
"web_search_options": {
  "user_location": {
    "country": "US"
  }
}
```

**Combining Latitude/Longitude and Country Code:**

```json
"web_search_options": {
  "user_location": {
    "latitude": 48.8566, 
    "longitude": 2.3522,
    "country": "FR" // Example: Paris, France
  }
}
```

These filters work alongside other search parameters like date range or domain filters.

## Examples

**1. Refining Results with Latitude and Longitude**

This example provides specific coordinates (approximating San Francisco) to get geographically relevant search results.

**Request Example**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl --location 'https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      "model": "sonar-pro",
      "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful local guide."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What are some good coffee shops nearby?"}
      ],
      "web_search_options": {
        "user_location": {
          "latitude": 37.7749,
          "longitude": -122.4194
        }
      }
  }'
  ```

  ```python Python
  import requests

  url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
  headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
  payload = {
      "model": "sonar-pro",
      "messages": [
          {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful local guide."},
          {"role": "user", "content": "What are some good coffee shops nearby?"}
      ],
      "web_search_options": {
        "user_location": {
          "country": "US",
          "latitude": 37.7749,
          "longitude": -122.4194
        }
      }
  }

  response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
  print(response.json())
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**2. Refining Results with Country Code**

This example uses a two-letter ISO country code (United States) to provide broader geographic context.

**Request Example**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl --location 'https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      "model": "sonar-pro",
      "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert on international news."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize today's political news."}
      ],
      "web_search_options": {
        "user_location": {
          "country": "US"
        }
      }
  }'
  ```

  ```python Python
  import requests

  url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
  headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
  payload = {
      "model": "sonar-pro",
      "messages": [
          {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert on international news."},
          {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize today's political news."}
      ],
      "web_search_options": {
        "user_location": {
          "country": "US"
        }
      }
  }

  response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
  print(response.json())
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**3. Combining Coordinates and Country Code**

This example provides both specific coordinates (approximating Paris) and the country code ("FR") for maximum geographic context.

**Request Example**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl --location 'https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      "model": "sonar-pro",
      "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert on French news and events."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What major events are happening in the capital this week?"}
      ],
      "web_search_options": {
        "user_location": {
          "latitude": 48.8566, 
          "longitude": 2.3522,
          "country": "FR"
        }
      }
  }'
  ```

  ```python Python
  import requests

  url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
  headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
  payload = {
      "model": "sonar-pro",
      "messages": [
          {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert on French news and events."},
          {"role": "user", "content": "What major events are happening in the capital this week?"}
      ],
      "web_search_options": {
        "user_location": {
          "latitude": 48.8566, 
          "longitude": 2.3522,
          "country": "FR"
        }
      }
  }

  response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
  print(response.json())
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

**Choosing the Right Specificity**
•	**Latitude/Longitude:** Use for high precision when the exact location is known and relevant (e.g., finding nearby points of interest).
•	**Country Code:** Use for broader context when country-level relevance is sufficient (e.g., national news, country-specific regulations).
•	**Combining Fields:** Providing both coordinates and country code can offer the most context. The coordinates give precision, while the country code adds broader regional signals (like language or national context) that might influence results.

**Data Accuracy**
•	Ensure the provided location data is as accurate as possible. Incorrect data may lead to irrelevant results.
•	Latitude values must be between -90 and 90. Longitude values must be between -180 and 180.
•	Country codes should be valid two-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes (e.g., "US", "GB", "DE").

**Privacy Considerations**
•	Be mindful of user privacy when collecting and transmitting location data. Only use location when necessary and with user consent where applicable.

**Client-Side Validation**
•	Consider validating location inputs before sending the request:

* Check latitude/longitude ranges.
* Validate country code format (two uppercase letters).
